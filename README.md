<a href="https://carrot.ac.uk/">Carrot Mapper</a> is a webapp which allows the user to use the metadata (as output by [WhiteRabbit](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit)) from a dataset to produce mapping rules to the OMOP standard, in the JSON format. These can be ingested by [Carrot Transform](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/carrot-transform) to perform the mapping of the contents of the dataset to OMOP.

Carrot Mapper provides automated mapping from a selection of vocabularies, reuse of mapping rules across datasets, and manual mapping rule generation. It also provides a number of helpful features to support and encourage standardised mappings across datasets.
