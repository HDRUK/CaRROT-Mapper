# Introduction
The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, severely strained health systems
and damaged economies across the world. At this time there is limited evidence that people who have recovered
from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection and if so, how long that lasts.
Understanding who is immune is vital to protect vulnerable individuals, to safely scale back population-based
interventions and for managing disease transmission.

The data which can help us to answer these key questions have been collected across the UK by a range of
research groups and within routine clinical primary and secondary care settings. As this is a new disease the
standards for antibody data capture are in their infancy so some of the details needed to answer the key
questions are not being captured systematically. The fragmented landscape of data means that it can be
challenging for public health groups and researchers to find and access the high-quality data they need at pace.
CO-CONNECT will:

*    Provide a mechanism, via the HDR Gateway, to allow researchers to find what relevant datasets reside
where and under what access conditions
*    Configure an infrastructure which enables trustworthy, fast, de-identified, secure analysis of data from
across multiple organisations
*    Standardise antibody data collection across the UK
*    Align with the National Core Studies programme
*    Answer key questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the implications for patient outcomes.

This repository will aid in these goals by helping develop the software which facilitates the data pipelines and implements the different tools required for searching, accumulating, and analyzing the data.
