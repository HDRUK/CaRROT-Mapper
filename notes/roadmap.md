# Carrot Rules Roadmap

Level 0:
Enable users to select which rules to reuse (from projects, datasets)

Level 1:
Upload Mapping Rules
Allow them to be reused

Level 2:
Allow Scan Report Rules to be versioned.

Level 3:
Add provenance to SR Concepts.

Level 4:
Allow Rule Sets to be versioned.

Level 5:
Allow Rule Sets to be "forked". ?

Level 6:
Allow analytics on Rule Sets.
Is this the responsbility of Carrot?
Maybe... but it ideally on the global viewer.
