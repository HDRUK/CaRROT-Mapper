# Level 1; Upload Rules

We could just create the structure of the rule set without a scan report
As in - create the ScanReportTable, ScanReportField, and all the ScanReportConcepts

Generate ScanReportTable, ScanReportFields, ScanReportConcepts from RuleSet

Update these models to make a link to a Scan Report optional.
Update these models to add an optional fk to a Rule Set.

## User

Upload Rule Set
User uploads via a form, and sets reuse terms, license etc.
You can explore the Rules through a sort of skeleton scan report.
A rule set is locked automatically.
Level 4: A user can create a "version" of this ruleset, and soft delete Scan Report Concepts.

We want to avoid creating SRConcepts for every fork and version though...
So soft delete enables that.

## Work

### Data

- New RuleSet model
- rule_set fk on ScanReportConcept
- rule_set fk on ScanReportTable
- rule_set fk on MappingRule

- RulesSet edit form
- List RulesSet on Datasets
- RuleSet explore (similar to Scan Report)

### Backend
