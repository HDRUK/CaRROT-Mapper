# Level 2; Upload a Scan Report

## User

Automatically creates a RuleSet live "version"
We name it 0.0.1.
Users map data.
They "save" to the live version every time they map/delete.
They can enable reuse of their live version.

They can create a new "version".
This locks the old one for mapping changes.
All new mappings are done to the new version.
If a SRConcept is deleted, then it is soft deleted by this rule set.
