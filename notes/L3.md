# Level 3; Provenance

Enable a user to observe the provenance of a mapping rule.

Source: A SRConcept can reference another SRConcept as its 'source' by foreign key.
Who: Add "created_by" user - this is the user name for now, we could add profiles / orchid ID later on.
How: Add "tool" - 'carrot-mapper', 'lettuce' etc. This is set by the user only when they upload a rule set, otherwise we default to 'carrot-mapper' for any manual mappings.
Why: Add "description" as a text field. OR explore ontology mapping predicates ? We could do both.
